Dealr is an iOS App - written in Swift 4 - that lets a new car buyer find, contact and negotiatie with car dealers. Users can contact as many dealers as they choose to let them compete with written offers on an "out-the-door" price. When the user finds the right dealer they simply take their offer in to sign the paperwork and drive out with their new car!
